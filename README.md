# Face Verification with Siamese Neural Network

A facial verification project using a Siamese Neural Network, implemented in Python with TensorFlow, matplotlib, and OpenCV.


## Introduction

This project utilizes a Siamese Neural Network to perform facial verification, allowing users to verify whether two faces belong to the same person or not. The implementation is based on Python, TensorFlow for neural network development, matplotlib for visualization, and OpenCV for image processing.

## Features

- Facial verification using a Siamese Neural Network.
- Python implementation for flexibility and ease of use.
- Integration with TensorFlow for efficient neural network training.
- Visualizations using matplotlib for better understanding and analysis.
- Utilizes OpenCV for image processing tasks.
